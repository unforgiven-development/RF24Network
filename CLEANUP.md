# RF24 Libraries Cleanup Project #
Each component of the _RF24_ set of libraries by _TMRh20_ will have a **CLEANUP.md** file, which shall contain notes
about what has been done to cleanup and/or improve the library.

## TODO ##
There are a variety of goals in this project, but the overall goal is to simplify the building, installation, configuration, and use of the Library.

Initially, the emphasis will be on the Linux platforms, particularly the Raspberry Pi. Following that, the Arduino-type platforms will be targeted.

* Remove unnecessary directories/structure
* Remove deprecated/unneeded files
* Improve Makefile structure (project-wide)
* Improve testing
* Improve documentation
